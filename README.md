# Breast Cancer Binary Classification Project

This project demonstrates a basic binary classification workflow using the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Project Steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.
2.  **Data Preparation**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
3.  **Feature Scaling**: Scale the numerical features to improve model performance.
4.  **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model on the prepared data.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like classification report, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC.

## Dataset:

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset available in scikit-learn. It contains features computed from images of breast masses.

## Model:

A Logistic Regression model is used for binary classification.

## Results:

The evaluation metrics (classification report, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC) indicate that the trained Logistic Regression model performs well on this dataset.
